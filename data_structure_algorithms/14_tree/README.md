## Terms
- Path: the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree
- Root: the node at the top of the tree; only one
- Parent: any node except the root that has a child
- Child: the node that has a parent
- Leaf: node with no child
- Subtree: the descendants of a node
- Visiting: checking the value of a node when control is on the node
- Traversing: passing through nodes in a specific order
- Levels: represents the generation of a node. If the root is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1
- Keys: represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
- Height (of a tree): the length of the longest path to a leaf
- Depth (of a node): the length of the path to its root

## Binary Tree
Basic operations:
- Insert
- Search
- Pre-order traversal
- Inorder traversal
- Postorder traversal
